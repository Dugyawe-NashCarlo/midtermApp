<p>Rocks are the solid, naturally occurring, and coherent aggregates of minerals or mineraloids that form the Earth's crust and provide the foundation for all terrestrial landscapes. They are fundamentally categorized into three main types based on their formation processes: igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic. Igneous rocks are born of fire, formed through the cooling and solidification of molten magma below the surface (intrusive) or lava on the surface (extrusive), with common examples being granite and basalt. Sedimentary rocks are formed at the Earth's surface through the accumulation, compaction, and cementation of sediments—pieces of broken, pre-existing rock, organic material, or chemical precipitates—often settling in layers, or strata, in water or on land, and these are the primary rocks containing fossils. Metamorphic rocks are created when pre-existing igneous or sedimentary rocks are subjected to immense heat, pressure, or chemically active fluids, causing them to transform in texture and mineral composition without melting, turning, for instance, limestone into marble or shale into slate. Over millions of years, these types continuously change into one another through a process known as the rock cycle, driven by tectonic activity, weathering, and erosion. Rocks vary greatly in appearance, color, and texture, providing crucial clues about the history of the Earth, and they have been used by humanity for millions of years for tools, construction, and art.</p>
